# Security

This app provides remote control capabilities (screenshot + UI inspection + input automation) and should be treated as sensitive.

## Recommended safe usage

- Keep the IP allowlist enabled.
- Only allow a single trusted IP (or narrow CIDR) for your workstation.
- Use on a trusted LAN; avoid public Wi-Fi.
- If you need remote access, put it behind a VPN you control rather than opening the port to the internet.

## Reporting issues

If you find a security vulnerability, please open a GitHub issue with enough detail to reproduce.

If you'd rather not post details publicly, open an issue that says you have a report and we can coordinate a private channel.
